Project-1:Classification of penguin species based on gender prediction


Introduction:

In this portfolio, I will discuss the classification of penguin species based on gender prediction. Penguins are flightless birds that are found in the southern hemisphere, and they are well-known for their tuxedo-like appearance. There are a variety of penguin species, and one common challenge is accurately determining the gender of individual birds. In this portfolio, I will explore different machine learning models to predict the gender of penguins based on their physical characteristics.

Data:




The data used in this project was obtained from the Kaggle. It contains information on 344 penguins of three different species: Adelie, Gentoo, and Chinstrap. Each penguin is described by various physical attributes such as bill length, bill depth, flipper length, and body mass. The target variable in this classification problem is the gender of the penguin, which is labeled as either male or female.




Exploratory Data Analysis:




Before building any machine learning models, it's important to understand the data and explore any patterns or relationships. I started by visualizing the distribution of the target variable across the three penguin species. I found that there was a relatively equal distribution of male and female penguins across all three species.





Next, I explored the correlations between the physical attributes and the target variable. I found that flipper length had the strongest correlation with gender, while bill depth had the weakest correlation.




Modeling:



To predict the gender of penguins based on their physical attributes, I trained several machine learning models, including Logistic Regression, Support  Vector Machine, Random Forest Algorithm, XGBoost Algorithm.



Conclusion:




In this portfolio, I explored the classification of penguin species based on gender prediction. Using various machine learning models, I was able to accurately predict the gender of penguins based on their physical characteristics. The random forest and SVM models achieved the highest accuracy scores, suggesting that they are the best models for this particular classification problem. This work can be extended to explore other features or attributes of penguins, such as habitat or diet, and how they relate to gender.

Project-2:Exploratory Data Analysis on football match results and prediction using Machine Learning Algorithms



Introduction:




In this portfolio, I will discuss exploratory data analysis (EDA) on football match results and the prediction of a betting model using machine learning algorithms. Football is one of the most popular sports in the world, and many people enjoy betting on the outcomes of matches. In this project, I will analyze historical football match results to identify patterns and relationships that can inform the development of a betting model.

Data:




The data used in this project was obtained from the Open Football API, which provides access to historical football match results for various leagues and competitions around the world. The data contains information on the date of the match, the teams playing, the final score, and various other statistics such as shots on target and possession percentage.

Exploratory Data Analysis:



Before building any machine learning models, it's important to understand the data and explore any patterns or relationships. I started by visualizing the distribution of the final scores of matches across various leagues and competitions. I found that the most common final score was 1-0, followed by 2-1 and 2-0.

Next, I explored the relationship between the number of shots on target and the final score of matches. I found that there was a strong positive correlation between the two variables, suggesting that teams that take more shots on target are more likely to win.



Modeling:

To predict the outcomes of football matches and develop a betting model, I trained several machine learning models, including logistic regression, decision tree, random forest, and support vector machine (SVM).




Conclusion:

In this portfolio, I explored exploratory data analysis on football match results and the prediction of a betting model using machine learning algorithms. Using various machine learning models, I was able to accurately predict the outcomes of football matches based on historical data. The random forest  model achieved the highest accuracy scores, suggesting that they are the best models for this particular prediction problem. This work can be extended to include additional variables, such as weather conditions or injuries to key players, that may impact the outcome of matches. Overall, this project highlights the potential of machine learning in sports betting and data analysis.
