Project-1:Classification of penguin species based on gender prediction


Introduction:

In this portfolio, I will discuss the classification of penguin species based on gender prediction. Penguins are flightless birds that are found in the southern hemisphere, and they are well-known for their tuxedo-like appearance. There are a variety of penguin species, and one common challenge is accurately determining the gender of individual birds. In this portfolio, I will explore different machine learning models to predict the gender of penguins based on their physical characteristics.

Data:

The data used in this project was obtained from the Kaggle. It contains information on 344 penguins of three different species: Adelie, Gentoo, and Chinstrap. Each penguin is described by various physical attributes such as bill length, bill depth, flipper length, and body mass. The target variable in this classification problem is the gender of the penguin, which is labeled as either male or female.

Exploratory Data Analysis:

Before building any machine learning models, it's important to understand the data and explore any patterns or relationships. I started by visualizing the distribution of the target variable across the three penguin species. I found that there was a relatively equal distribution of male and female penguins across all three species.

Next, I explored the correlations between the physical attributes and the target variable. I found that flipper length had the strongest correlation with gender, while bill depth had the weakest correlation.

Modeling:

To predict the gender of penguins based on their physical attributes, I trained several machine learning models, including logistic regression, decision tree, random forest, and support vector machine (SVM). 

Conclusion:

In this portfolio, I explored the classification of penguin species based on gender prediction. Using various machine learning models, I was able to accurately predict the gender of penguins based on their physical characteristics. The random forest and SVM models achieved the highest accuracy scores, suggesting that they are the best models for this particular classification problem. This work can be extended to explore other features or attributes of penguins, such as habitat or diet, and how they relate to gender.
